faster than the stock telnet.d wrapper and passes the proper hostname and
ip address for logging connections in Mystic

OR

Run "./make.sh -install as root to compile and install ddtelnetd in /usr/bin

[Configuration]

Edit the sample telnet file that is inculded and replace the username with
the user Mystic runs under, replace the path to where your Mystic executable
is located and edit the path to where the compiled ddtelnetd file is located.
if you did not choose to instal it to /usr/bin 

Copy the telnet config file to your xinetd.d folder replacing your current
file.
